# BLUEBikes Demand Prediction

Machine Learning models that aim to predict demand of bikes from stations on the *BLUEBikes* bike-sharing system in Boston, using both historical bike trip data and meteorological data as inputs.

Originally developed for a class project at Northeastern Univeristy for the *Introduction to Data Science* course (DS3000).
